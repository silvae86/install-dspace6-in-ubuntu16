  # If there's a single path you do NOT want redirected, you can use ! to ignore it
  # In this case any requests to "/ignored_path" will be handled by Apache HTTPD and NOT forwarded to Tomcat
  #ProxyPass  /ignored_path  !

  # These configurations say: By default, redirect ALL requests to port 8009
  # (The port MUST match the port of your Tomcat AJP Connector. By default this usually is 8009)
  ProxyPass         /  ajp://localhost:8009/jspui
  ProxyPassReverse  /  ajp://localhost:8009/jspui

  # You may also wish to provide additional "mod_proxy" configurations,
  # for more examples and details see the documentation at
  # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html
