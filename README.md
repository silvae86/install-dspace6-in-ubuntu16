# DSpace 6.x on Ubuntu 16.04

Installation scripts for DSpace 6.x on an Ubuntu 16.04 Machine powered by Vagrant.

Includes custom metadata importing by field mapping in the `bte.xml` file. 

Also supports the case when you have more than one value for a metadata descriptor, just separate them like this in the CSV:
