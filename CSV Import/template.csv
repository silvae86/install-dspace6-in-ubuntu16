In this study, the DataONE Usability and Assessment working group addresses two primary goals: To examine the current state of data sharing and reuse perceptions and practices among research scientists as they compare to the 2009/2010 baseline study, and to examine differences in practices and perceptions across age groups, geographic regions, and subject disciplines. We distributed surveys to a multinational sample of scientific researchers at two different time periods (October 2009 to July 2010 and October 2013 to March 2014) to observe current states of data sharing and to see what, if any, changes have occurred in the past 3-4 years. We also looked at differences across age, geographic, and discipline-based groups as they currently exist in the 2013/2014 survey. Results point to increased acceptance of and willingness to engage in data sharing, as well as an increase in actual data sharing behaviors. However, there is also increased perceived risk associated with data sharing, and specific barriers to data sharing persist. There are also differences across age groups, with younger respondents feeling more favorably toward data sharing and reuse, yet making less of their data available than older respondents. Geographic differences exist as well, which can in part be understood in terms of collectivist and individualist cultural differences. An examination of subject disciplines shows that the constraints and enablers of data sharing and reuse manifest differently across disciplines. Implications of these findings include the continued need to build infrastructure that promotes data sharing while recognizing the needs of different research communities. Moving into the future, organizations such as DataONE will continue to assess, monitor, educate, and provide the infrastructure necessary to support such complex grand science challenges.",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0134826",,"https://www.mendeley.com/research-papers/changes-data-sharing-data-reuse-practices-perceptions-among-scientists-worldwide/?utm_source=desktop&utm_medium=1.17.9&utm_campaign=open_catalog&userDocumentId=%7B43453eea-5814-4756-a63f-bc478098dd96%7D",10,8,"1932-6203",1,,,,,"ACM Digital Library",,,,,,"Mendeley",,,,,,"+"

In one vision of the future, the data required to validate or extend a research study is readily available, and the publication of data itself will bear an equal importance to that of the article publication. The data curation community is eager to help catalyze that transformation through services and advocacy. Yet in practice, it's not uncommon to encounter scientists who question the cost-benefit ratio of the time and effort involved with curation, publication, and preservation of research data. How can something that seems so self-evident to the data curation community be so challenging to implement in the wild? One possible reason is that libraries and the data curation community grav-itate towards the progressive ideals of open science; 1 however, by its very na-ture, progressive is not representative. Data curators are well acquainted with the shortcomings of current data sharing practices, such as the over-use of PDFs for data publication, which restricts reuse by encapsulating otherwise useful data in this traditional publication format. However, such practices have been in place",,,,"Association of College and Research Libraries",,,,,,,,,,"College of Research Libraries",,,,,,"Google",,,,,,"+"

Wicked problems are unique, complex problems which are defined differently by different stakeholders making them particularly intractable. Data from 26 semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews with librarians was analysed to see how far their perceptions of research data management aligned with the 16 features of a wicked problem identified from the literature. To a large extent research data management is perceived to be wicked, though over time good practices may emerge to help to ‘tame’ the problem. How interviewees thought research data management should be approached reflected this realisation. The generic value of the concept of wicked problems is considered and some first thoughts about how the curriculum for new entrants to the profession can prepare them for such problems are presented.",,,"10.1177/0961000614533717",,,,,,,,,,,"ACM Digital Library",,,,,,"Mendeley",,,,,,"+"
